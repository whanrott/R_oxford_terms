# R_oxford_terms

a quick R script which produces a data frame containing term dates for University of Oxford

To do:
* derive a data frame containing term weeks from the term dates
* create functions:
  * is.oxford_term which returns whether a date is within an Oxford term
  * oxford_term which returns which Term name a date is within
  * oxford_term_week which returns which week of term a date is within

Clearly I need to tidy up my naming of data frames and functions
